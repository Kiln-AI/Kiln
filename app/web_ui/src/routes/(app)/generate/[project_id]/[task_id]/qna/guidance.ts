export const DEFAULT_QNA_GUIDANCE = `For each text:
1. Generate clear, specific questions/queries that can be answered using the content
2. Provide accurate, complete answers based solely on the document content
3. Vary question types/query intents (factual, conceptual, procedural, etc.)

Focus on:
