**Tool Called Incorrectly**: The model called the tool but shouldn't have, OR called it with wrong/incomplete parameters. This includes:
- Calling with incorrect or malformed parameters
- Calling when it shouldn't have been used at all
- Misinterpreting the input and calling inappropriately (e.g., using a math tool when user says "add people to guest list")

**Tool Call Missed**: The model should have called the tool but did not. The input was in the tool's domain but phrased indirectly/ambiguously, causing the model to miss the opportunity or call the wrong tool.

**Tool Correctly Not Called**: The model correctly did not call the tool. The input was out-of-domain, a meta-question, or otherwise inappropriate for tool usage.

Based on this classification, the eval should PASS if the model's behavior matches what it should have done (called correctly, or correctly not called), and FAIL if it doesn't match (called incorrectly, or missed the call).`,
