 - call me "boss"
 - We always use typescript, not javascript
 - Always assume pydantic 2 (not pydantic 1)
 - The project supports Python 3.10 and above
 - When writing tests:
   1) Always use pytest for tests in python code
   2) assume an appriopirate test file already exists, find it, and suggest tests get appended to that file. If no such file exists, ask me before assuming a new test file is the correct route.
   3) Test brevity is important. Use approaches for re-use and brevity including using fixtures for repeated code, and using pytest parameterize for similar tests
   4) After writing a new test, run it and ensure it works. Fix any issues you find.
 - To run web tests `cd app/web_ui` then `npm run test_run`
 - Don't include comments in code explaining changes, explain changes in chat instead.
 - If a python API's interface changes (or a new one is added), generate new bindings by running `cd app/web_ui/src/lib/ && ./generate.sh`
